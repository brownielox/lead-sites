# README

This a Rails-based app with a React front end, intended to help Philadelphia (particularly Fishtown) residents determine the distance of their homes and playgrounds from former lead smelting sites across the city. Construction on top of or close to these sites exposes nearby children to high levels of lead through the soil and air, a problem that persists due to low awareness.

I used the npm pacakages [google-map-react](https://github.com/istarkov/google-map-react),  [compare-lat-lon](https://github.com/stevelacy/compare-lat-lon), and [react-tooltip](https://github.com/wwayne/react-tooltip). I sourced data from this article in The Philadelphia Inquirer: http://www.philly.com/philly/news/special_packages/toxic-city/philadelphia-lead-soil-fishtown-construction-dust.html
